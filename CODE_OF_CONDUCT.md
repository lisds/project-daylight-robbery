# Code of Conduct

This project is made up of members with a diverse set of skills,
personalities, background, and experiences. We welcome these differences because they are the
source of diverse ideas, solutions and decisions about our work.

## Our Pledge

We as members and contributors pledge to make participation in this project
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### A member of the this project is:

#### Open

Members of the project are open to collaboration. Be it on the reuse of data, on the
implementation of methods, on finding technical solutions, establishing best practices, and
otherwise. We are accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an
environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

#### Collaborative

Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we
make something for the benefit of others, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that
they can build on the work to make it even better. We are willing to provide constructive criticism
on the work of others and accept criticism of our own work, as the experiences and skill sets of
other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.

#### Inquisitive

Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are
encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be
responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving neuroimaging practice.

#### Considerate

Members of the community are considerate of their peers. We are thoughtful when addressing the
efforts of others, keeping in mind that often-times the labor was completed simply for the good of
the community. We are attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we are
tactful when approaching differing views.

#### Careful in the words we choose

We value courtesy, kindness and inclusiveness in all our interactions. Therefore, we take
responsibility for our own speech. In particular, we avoid:

 * Personal insults.
 * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
 * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 * Any form of sexual or violent material.
 * Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly.
 * Excessive or unnecessary profanity.
 * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

#### Concise

Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by others. Writing a short message means
people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Even short messages should always
strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary,
consider adding a summary.

Try to bring new ideas to a conversation, so that each message adds something unique to the
conversation. Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly long and complex.

#### Respectful

Members of the community are respectful. We are respectful of others, their positions, their
skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We are respectful of the volunteer and professional
efforts that permeate the project. We are respectful of the processes set forth in the
project, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous and kind in raising our
issues.

## Incident Reporting

We put great value on being respectful, friendly and helpful.

If you see any behavior within the project that lacks respect, is unfriendly or unhelpful,
please try the following steps:

* If you feel able, please let the person in question know that you found their behavior
  disrespectful / unhelpful / unfriendly, and why;

* If you don't feel able to do that, or that didn't work, please contact [Tom Fox][tom] directly
  by email (<tfox@hey.com>), and he will do his best to resolve it.
